We liked to mash up the entire box of Junior Mints into one big ball. Make it into the Death Star and eat it like Jedi Knights. We tied Red Vines together till we could climb out of our lives and into the white light of heaven. Our shoes stuck to the floor like fly paper; the buzz of people waiting for the lights to dim. Would hide in the bathroom so we could watch again. Stale scent of history burned at the edges of our existence. Memory of car chases and falling in love. We always wanted a refill.
